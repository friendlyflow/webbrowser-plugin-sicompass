Update this repo's dependencies. It is a mechanical chore, so no refactoring and
no unrelated cleanups. The result is one commit.

This file is also what `/update-cargo <this repo>` follows when it is run from
a sicompass checkout. **Prefix every command with `cd PROJECT_ROOT &&`.**

1. `git status --short` must be empty. A dependency commit contains nothing
   else.
2. `cargo update`.
3. With `major` in `$ARGUMENTS`: list held-back crates with
   `cargo update --dry-run --verbose 2>&1 | grep -i available`, and raise their
   requirements in `Cargo.toml`. Skip any requirement that has a comment
   explaining a pin, and ask before touching it. Then `cargo update` again.
   First-party git dependencies (`sicompass-ui`, `sicompass-sync`) are
   pinned by `rev`/`tag` and are moved by a release, not here.
4. `nix flake update`.
5. Build and test in **this repo's own** dev shell (`nix develop -c ...` run
   here). A shell entered from another checkout can lack this repo's targets.
   - `cargo build`, then `cargo test`. A plugin is a program like any other,
     and `./scripts/release-plugin.sh --dry-run` then builds this computer's
     release and verifies it the way the Store will.

   If a bumped crate needs a large migration, revert that one requirement, note
   it as held back, and continue. Never weaken a test to get it to pass.
6. `cargo about generate about.hbs -o THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.html` (cargo-about
   0.9.2). The file names every crate with its exact version, so any crate that
   moved makes it stale, and the `licenses.yml` check fails on a stale file.
7. `git diff --stat` should show only `Cargo.lock`, `flake.lock`,
   `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.html`, and with `major` also `Cargo.toml`.
8. Commit on `main`: `chore: update Cargo.lock and flake.lock dependencies`, or
   `Update cargo dependencies (crate X, crate Y)` with a body naming anything
   held back. No co-author trailer.
9. With `push` in `$ARGUMENTS`: `git push origin HEAD:main`.
10. Report which crates moved, which were held back, and the test result.
